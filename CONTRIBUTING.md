# Contributing to JM Tech Centre Website

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the JM Tech Centre website as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Coding Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Run `pnpm lint` before submitting code
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Maintain the Tailwind CSS approach for styling

## Project Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js 16.x or higher installed
2. Install pnpm if you don't have it already: `npm install -g pnpm`
3. Clone the repository
4. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
5. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server

## Testing

Run `pnpm test` to run the test suite.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Before you submit one, please check if it's already been requested. When submitting a feature request, please include:

- Clear and specific description of the feature
- The motivation behind it
- How it should work
- Any alternative solutions you've considered
